## 🚀 Core Architectural Philosophy

### 1. Zero-Friction / 100% Client-Side
* **Single API Dependency:** Relies ONLY on the Gemini API, eliminating all external data source complexity (CORS, Proxies, etc.).
* **Zero Latency:** All logic runs instantly in the user's browser, maximizing performance.

### 2. Privacy & Control (BYO Key)
* **API Key is Local:** Requires the user's own Google Gemini API key, which is saved securely only in the browser's local storage.
* **Data Stays Local:** User text and the resulting analysis are never transmitted to a third-party server or logged.

## 💡 Transformation Logic (The Editor's Process)

The AI strictly follows a dynamic prioritization engine to ensure the most critical fix (Error, Complexity, Verbosity) is addressed first. The output is always delivered in structured Markdown blocks for easy copying.
