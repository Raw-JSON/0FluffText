# 0FluffText ✨✍️
**No filler. No waffle. Just clean, structured text transformations.**

A tight, minimalist, client-side tool powered by the Gemini API that flips any chunk of text into **six refined versions** instantly — no fluff, no rambling, no drama.

## 🚀 Core Architectural Philosophy

### 1. Zero-Friction / Pure Client-Side
- **Single dependency:** Gemini API only. No random CDN requests, no proxies, no backend circus.
- **Instant response:** Everything processes in your browser for straight-up max performance.

### 2. Privacy & Control (BYO Key)
- **Your Key, Your Storage:** API key lives *only* in local storage.  
- **Your Text Stays Local:** Nothing gets uploaded. Nothing gets logged. Nothing leaves your device.

## 🛠 Quick Setup (Bring Your Own Key)

1. Grab a free key from **Google AI Studio**.  
2. Open **0FluffText**, smash the **Gear ⚙️**, paste the key.  
3. Paste any messy text into the box → hit **Enhance Text** → get instant, structured Markdown output.

## 💡 Transformation Logic
0FluffText runs a priority engine that fixes the biggest problem first — **Errors → Complexity → Verbosity** — then outputs everything as clean Markdown blocks for easy copy/paste.
