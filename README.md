# 0FluffText ✨🎓
> **Stop guessing. Start learning. The minimalist editor that teaches you to write better.**

**0FluffText** is a privacy-first, client-side writing engine. It doesn't just transform your text into seven distinct styles—it identifies your writing weaknesses and explains the "why" behind every correction.

## 🚀 What's New in v1.3.1 (The Modular Era)

### 🎓 The Coach's Critique
We’ve moved beyond simple "fixing." Every time you enhance text, the AI acts as a writing mentor, isolating issues like passive voice, hedging, or redundancy, and providing a brief educational lesson.

### 📚 Style Library (P1 Feature)
You are no longer limited to one custom style. You can now save up to **5 custom transformation profiles** (e.g., "Sarcastic Roaster," "Legal Tech," "Nautical Pirate") directly in your browser.

### 🏗️ 0Fluff Architecture
The codebase has been refactored for "0Fluff" efficiency:
- **`engine.js`**: The brains. Handles prompt engineering and API logic.
- **`app.js`**: The hands. Manages the UI, state, and local storage.
- **`service-worker.js`**: PWA support with intelligent cache versioning.
